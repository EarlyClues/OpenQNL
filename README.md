QNL-QuasiNaturalLanguage
========================

QNL stands for Quasi-Natural Language, and is a member of the RSL (Reality-Shaping Languages) family of query and programmatic languages. It was originalled developed for use with SearchWithin, the "Open-Source Inner Search" / the world's first search engine for inner-computing.

SearchWithin: https://github.com/EarlyClues/SearchWithin

Within compatible environments (for example: the human subconscious, dream-worlds, programmatic & augmented spaces), QNL acts as a para-language which not only expresses a concept or transmits a message, but also programmatically executes a function or protocol when it encounters a receptive environment or agent. 

QNL queries or commands may be expressed vocally or in written form, and are transmitted through liminal spaces to reach their intended destination or effect. 

# Sample Usage

```
/* EXAMPLE: Wild-card search */
SearchWithin() for '*'; send to background; RunWhile Sleeping; print-results OnWaking
```

```  
/* EXAMPLE: System Clean-Up */
RunOn: SearchWithin(FullSystem)
{
AutoCleanup && Repairs && Calibration;
print-results in symbol format OnWaking(Tomorrow);
ReturnResults in memory;
}
/* ThanksAmen; Please RT on AstralPlane! */
```

```
/* EXAMPLE: Dream-continuation routine */
OnWaking {
  Hold dream in memory;
  OnSleep {
    Return.to(dream);
    }
  }
